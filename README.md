# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

This repository showcases a Machine Learning pipeline for sentiment analysis of tweets. The project processes text data, extracts features, trains a classification model, and provides an interactive interface for real-time sentiment prediction.

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This project predicts whether a tweet expresses a **positive** or **negative** sentiment. It uses the **Sentiment140** dataset, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.

---

## 🛠️ **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Text cleaning to remove non-alphabetic characters.
  - Removal of stopwords and stemming to simplify text data.
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Text data is converted into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- **Model Training**:
  - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model for sentiment classification.
- **Interactive Predictions**:
  - Real-time sentiment prediction using a simple GUI.
- **Model Saving**:
  - The trained model is saved using **Pickle** for future use.

---

## 📂 **Dataset**

The dataset used is [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140), which contains 1.6 million labeled tweets.

## 🛠️ **Libraries Used**

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming).
- **Scikit-learn**:
  - **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: For feature extraction.
  - **Logistic Regression**: For classification.
  - **Train-Test Split**: For splitting the data.
  - **Accuracy Metrics**: For model evaluation.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **Ipywidgets**: For creating an interactive interface in Jupyter notebooks.
